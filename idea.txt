my idea is this:

I do have resvice emails from the bank that shows my transactions (income/expanse) I want to make a program that will be connect
to the email to handle all the email messages that come from the bank, then parss and extract this data from the email :
{
transction_id,
date_time,
bank_name,
account_number,
transction_type,
trasction_resvier,
transction_maker,
}
this example of expanse email:
